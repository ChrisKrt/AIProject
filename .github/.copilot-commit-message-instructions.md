# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Instructions

## On main branch
Use Conventional Commits format for commit messages. 

There are three prefixes:

- `feat(#<pbi-number>):` for new user stories, grouped by PBI (Product Backlog Item) number
- `fix(#<pbi-number>):` for bug fixes
- `chore(#<pbi-number>):` for maintenance tasks (e.g. refactoring, documentation updates, clean up, etc.), Chores do not have to reference a PBI number, but it is recommended to do so if the chore is related to a specific PBI.

Feature commits should also reference the user story PBI number.

Example User Stories:

```
#1234 Authorization (The Feature)
#2222 Add Authorization support for role XYZ (One User Story)
#2223 Add Authorization support for role ABC (One User Story)
```

Example commit messages:
```
feat(#1234): #2222 Add Authorization support for role XYZ
feat(#1234): #2223 Add Authorization support for role ABC
```

## On other branches
When on feature/fix/chore branches, you should have a ToDo list what to do to solve the PBI. Each commit is one ToDo item. The commit message should be the ToDo item that you are solving with the commit.

Example commit message:
```Implement user login endpoint
```

## Expected Changelog
The changelog should look like this after merging to main:
```
