# Glossary
Everytime you introduce a new term in the documentation, add it to the glossary with a clear definition. This helps ensure that everyone has a common understanding of key concepts and terminology used throughout the project. The glossary should be organized alphabetically and include concise definitions for each term. This will make it easier for team members to reference and understand the terminology as they work on the project. Do not use multiple terms for the same concept; choose one term and use it consistently across all documentation. If a term has multiple meanings, provide context to clarify which meaning is being used in the project. Regularly review and update the glossary as new terms are introduced or existing definitions need refinement.
